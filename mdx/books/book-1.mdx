# Introduction

Book 1 is focused on **logic** concepts. The book will introduce basic propositional logic with flow charts. Pointing out that logic is one of many natural ways to think. Through learning some propositional logic with flow charts, the book can transition into boolean logic and binary. Thereby giving the reader a general principle of computing and help put together concepts like "everything is just 1s and 0s."

# Storyboard

_Note: This is broken up into different scenes._

## Phabby's House

- Phabby's parents are asking her what she would like this year for her birthday.
- She responds with a dog.
- They are not thrilled. They inform her taking care of a dog is a lot of work and are not optimistic she can handle the responsibility.
- Phabby, a little upset with the lack of faith, decides to go for a walk.

## Dologia Launch Site

- Choco is looking at instructions and information about Earth.
  - Point out that there are Doggo-like animals with diagrams on how they act.
- Choco waves to the other pilots and enters his vehicle and begins his inter-universe travels

## Nearby Park

- He lands on Earth, not far from Phabby's house at a park.
- Choco sees a boy and a dog playing, with the typical fetch interactions.
- He then sees Phabby walking by and proceeds to run to her with a stick in his mouth.
- Phabby feels like this a dream come true!
- She rushes home to share that she adopted a dog.

## Phabby's House

- Her parents, compassionate toward a stray, affirm that they will keep Choco for the interim until they come up with a plan.
- Phabby is elated with the responsibility.
- Choco notices the parents making a reminder on their smart speaker. He's excited to see that they have vernacular programming and that their world is not overly polluted and then starts to think that maybe there is something going on here.
- Phabby starts to eat breakfast at the kitchen table, which is connected to the living space with a desktop computer.
- Phabby's mom leaves for work.
- Phabby's dad starts a coding tutorial.
- Choco's mind explodes to see the dad turn on the computer and start to open up a code learning website.
- Phabby's dad gets a phone call and leaves the room.
- Choco runs up to the computer and is surprised by the code and the keyboard and begins to type random gibberish on the screen.
- Phabby notices Choco on the computer and is surprised.
- She runs over to Choco, but then Choco breaks character, asking what this is.
- Phabby is even more surprised when Choco begins to talk to her.
- Phabby is even more elated to have found a talking dog.
- Choco informs her that he is a Doggo and then goes into a quick backstory.
- Phabby, out of compassion for her new friend, wants to help and suggests they go to their neighbor's house. Her dad is being mentored by their neighbor.

## George Boole's House

- Their neighbor is **George Boole**. A self taught computer programmer that loves to ramble about being logical.
- He's not surprised by inter-universe travelling and Doggo's story. He felt that this would likely happen and before he starts to ramble about aliens in Egypt, Phabby and Doggo remind him that they need to go on a programming journey.
- He points out that they have already begun.

### Propositional Logic in the Everyday

- First points out, we naturally make a lot of logicaly sentences. Going forward we will call them **logic statements**
- At a basic level are often true or false statements or yes or no questions.
- A lot of the sentences we say are not logically precise and unsuable as logic statements, unless clearly defined.
- "Can you give me a second?"
  - Is this one second? Or is this a moment that is not too long?
  - But then what is too long of a moment to wait?
- "Do you dream in your sleep?"
  - This is a valid logical statement, but it is often used as a separate statemnet in everyday language. It's more "Do you remember your dreams?" An example of why as humans, we can communicate without logical precision.
- Another potential example "I need to work a full day tomorrow."
- George Boole explains
  - The statements above are common moments we have everyday and yet we all function okay.
  - The computer's mind does not understand this kind of reality.
  - We need to have it work at the true and false level.
- Phabby and Choco become really excited.
- Choco in Dologia they haven't been thinking with logical precision and it can become a key tool to fix their planet!

### Boolean Logic

- _Goal is to add complexity and structure to the previous examples_
- Include **operators** as a way to construct more advanced logic statements.
  - AND
  - OR
  - NOT
- Show set diagrams

### Binary Numbers

- Use fingers to illustrate numbers.
  - point out that our hands are base 10.
- Use lightbulbs to illustrate binary numbers in real life.
- In the past we would have large vacuum tubes.
- The computer than is using this system at a microscopic level.

# Concepts

_Note: These are older notes I will repurpose_

### 1. **Programming is a learning a new language**

- **Communication**
  - Programming is learning a new language
  - English / Human Communication
    - **One word or sentence can have multiple meanings**
      - "Can you give me a second?"
      - "It is really raining today!"
    - We also have communication cues that are non-verbal
    - We often speak in functions, that encapsulate a lot of commands.
      - Make a sandwich
        - What kind of sandwich
        - Toast the bread
        - etc ...
  - **Emphasize computer communication has one meaning**
    - This is why it is a logical communication system
    - Programming starts before the computer
    - Sometimes it's good even when talking to humans!
    - Tidbits
      - No context

### 2. **Intro to Programming Language Concepts.**

- **Unclear Definitions**
  - Logic is strict and removes the ambiguity.
  - What is a sandwich?
    - Hot dog a sandwich?
    - PB&J a sandwich?
    - Meat, cheese, veggie, bread?
- Some things in life are easy to map out as binary and others are degrees of truth. Or depending on how the question is asked, it can have more answers than yes and no. True or false.
- **Binary thinking**
  - We do this all the time, especially with political concepts
- **Introduce Control Flow**
