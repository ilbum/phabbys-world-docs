# Introduction

Book 1 is focused on **logic** concepts. The book will introduce basic propositional logic with flow charts. Pointing out that logic is one of many natural ways to think. But consistent usage is more unnatural. Through learning some propositional logic with flow charts, the book can transition into boolean logic and binary. Thereby giving the reader a general principle of computing and help put together concepts like "everything is just 1s and 0s."

# Storyboard

_Note: This is broken up into different scenes._

## Phabby's House

- Phabby's parents are asking her what she would like this year for her birthday.
- She responds with a dog.
- They are not thrilled. They inform her taking care of a dog is a lot of work and are not optimistic she can handle the responsibility.
- Phabby, a little upset with the lack of faith, decides to go for a walk.

## Dologia Launch Site

- Choco is looking at instructions and information about Earth.
  - Point out that there are Doggo-like animals with diagrams on how they act.
- Choco waves to the other pilots and enters his vehicle and begins his inter-universe travels

## Nearby Park

- He lands on Earth, not far from Phabby's house at a park.
- Choco sees a boy and a dog playing, with the typical fetch interactions.
- He then sees Phabby walking by and proceeds to run to her with a stick in his mouth.
- Phabby feels like this a dream come true!
- She rushes home to share that she adopted a dog.

## Phabby's House

- Her parents, compassionate toward a stray, affirm that they will keep Choco for the interim until they come up with a plan.
- Phabby is elated with the responsibility.
- Choco notices the parents making a reminder on their smart speaker. He's excited to see that they have vernacular programming and that their world is not overly polluted and then starts to think that maybe there is something going on here.
- Phabby starts to eat breakfast at the kitchen table, which is connected to the living space with a desktop computer.
- Phabby's mom leaves for work.
- Phabby's dad starts a coding tutorial.
- Choco's mind explodes to see the dad turn on the computer and start to open up a code learning website.
- Phabby's dad gets a phone call and leaves the room.
- Choco runs up to the computer and is surprised by the code and the keyboard and begins to type random gibberish on the screen.
- Phabby notices Choco on the computer and is surprised.
- She runs over to Choco, but then Choco breaks character, asking what this is.
- Phabby is even more surprised when Choco begins to talk to her.
- Phabby is even more elated to have found a talking dog.
- Choco informs her that he is a Doggo and then goes into a quick backstory.
- Phabby, out of compassion for her new friend, wants to help and suggests they go to their neighbor's house. Her dad is being mentored by their neighbor.

## Neighbors House

- Neighbor is George Boole. A self taught computer programmer that loves to ramble about math and stuff.
- He's not phased by inter-universe travelling and Doggo's story. He felt that this would likely happen and before he starts to ramble about aliens in Egypt, Phabby and Doggo remind him that they need to learn to program.
- He then begins to speak about propositional logic.
