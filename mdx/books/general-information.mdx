# Book Series

## 1 - Logic is my new language

### 1. Programming is a learning a new language\*\*

- **Communication**
  - Programming is learning a new language
  - English / Human Communication
    - **One word or sentence can have multiple meanings**
      - "Can you give me a second?"
      - "Do you dream in your sleep?"
      - "I need to work a full day tomorrow."
    - We also have communication cues that are non-verbal
    - We often speak in functions, that encapsulate a lot of commands.
      - Make a sandwich
        - What kind of sandwich
        - Toast the bread
        - etc ...
  - **Emphasize computer communication has one meaning**
    - This is why it is a logical communication system
    - Programming starts before the computer
    - Sometimes it's good even when talking to humans!
    - Tidbits
      - No context

### 2. **Intro to Programming Language Concepts.**

- **Unclear Definitions**
  - Logic is strict and removes the ambiguity.
  - What is a sandwich?
    - Hot dog a sandwich?
    - PB&J a sandwich?
    - Meat, cheese, veggie, bread?
- Some things in life are easy to map out as binary and others are degrees of truth. Or depending on how the question is asked, it can have more answers than yes and no. True or false.
- **Binary thinking**
  - We do this all the time, especially with political concepts
- **Introduce Control Flow**

## 2 - Inside the computer

- What is a computer?
  - Calculator is even a computer (fixed program computer)
    - We'd have to bring different devices to do different things
    - Now we have portable computers that do a lot of things.
  - Stored Program Computer
    - Machine that stores and executes programs
- Computer Diagram / Hardware
  - CPU
  - RAM
  - ROM
  - Buses
  - Long-term memory storage
    - Average smartphone has over 64 gb of memory
    - 1 megabyte can store a classic literature novel
    - Expect most computers to hold at least a million books
  - I/O Controller
  - Heatsink
- Tube to Transistor
  - Explain true and false / electric current on and off
    - punch card programming to programming languages

- Binary Math example
- Programming Languages

## 3 - Saving Time, Variables, Functions, Programs

## 4 - Saving Time, Variables, Functions, Programs Part 2

## 5 - Data to the Internet

- Data Structure
  - Store information
  - Access and manipulate information
- Databases
  - Store lots of information
  - Access and manipulate a lot of information
- Algorithms
  - Playing chess as an example
  - Experts suggest 10^123 different possible games
  - Only 10^80 atoms in the observable universe
  - Efficiency!
    - _Doggo's world problem, they don't even know what algorithms the computers are implementing, they didn't think about the resource cost and developed vernacular programming. They can speak and the computer will then implement whatever is said._
- Databases & the Internet
  - Any website with a login
  - Any website with a search engine
- Internet
  - Interconnected networks of computers
  - Phone number to names
  - DNS ip address to domains

## 6 - Internet of Things to AI

- IoT
  - Many things can be and are connected to the internet
  - Implication, gather data
- AI
  - AI Revolution
    - Data
    - High Performance Compute
  - Most of it is supervised learning
    - Input → Output
      - Email spam or not
      - Image to object identification
      - Audio to Text
      - Chinese to English
    - Requires a data team
    - Enough information to process things
  - Other types
    - Unsupervised learning
      - Clustering
    - Reinforcement Learning
      - AlphaGo
  - Machine Learning to Deep Learning
    - Neural Networks Examples
  - Reflect about why our brains are so amazing too!

## 7 - Security and Ethics

- What's legal vs what's right
- Malware and Trust
- Jailbreaking
- Walled garden
- Personal information
  - Passwords
  - Online behavior

## 8 - Making an App

- Apps are about considering all the things above
- In some sense apps are a collection of each
  - primitive operations → statements → functions → programs → apps
- Offering value to users
  - Solving problems is first a human exercise that is translated into application solutions.
- Thinking about databases
- Internet, Security, Ethics
