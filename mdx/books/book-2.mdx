# Concepts

- **Functions**
  - It may seem like more work, but do I want to explain every time what to sort in the trash? I save that information in advance.
- <GatsbyImage
    alt="From Algebraic Functions to Computer Functions"
    image={getImage(props.localImages[0])}
    className="max-width-40rem"
  />
- <GatsbyImage
    alt="Legal Function Syntax"
    image={getImage(props.localImages[1])}
    className="max-width-40rem"
  />
- **Abstraction** revisited, let's think at the level of abstraction, we don't need to think at a lower level, the 1s and 0s.
- **Encapsulation** black box, hide data and complexity but let you use the function
- When I save all the information, that makes a **program**
  - A multiple statements
  - Often multiple functions make up a program
