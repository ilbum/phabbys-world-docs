**Hero's Journey**

- Phabby starts out as an everyman. An ordinary and humble character who the reader can identify with.
- At the moment she finds joy in finally having a dog. She was excited to have responsibilities, but then it sort of drained her. Sheâ€™s in the process of learning that responsibilities require consistent action.
- She decides to rise to the challenge out of love and concern for Choco.
- At first it is the fear of losing Choco.
- At the moment she finds joy in finally having a dog. Having responsibility, but already she is finding it tiring.
